    API Calls:
    Record the various API (Application Programming Interface) calls that malware makes during execution. This includes calls to file operations, network communication, registry manipulation, process management, and more.

    System Calls:
    Similar to API calls, system calls involve interactions with the underlying operating system. These can include calls to read or write files, create or terminate processes, access the network, etc.

    Network Activities:
    Monitor network traffic generated by the malware. Capture information about connections made, protocols used, data sent and received, IP addresses, domains contacted, etc.

    File Interactions:
    Track the creation, modification, and deletion of files by the malware. This includes analyzing file paths, extensions, and content.

    Registry Modifications:
    Record changes made to the Windows Registry, which can provide insight into persistence mechanisms and configuration changes.

    Process Execution:
    Monitor the processes spawned by the malware, including their command-line arguments, parent-child relationships, and resource utilization.

    Memory Behavior:
    Analyze the malware's use of memory, including attempts to inject code into other processes, manipulate system memory, or evade detection by residing in memory only.

    Behavioral Sequences:
    Capture the order and combination of behaviors that malware exhibits over time. This can involve creating sequences of API calls, system calls, or network activities.

    Static Features:
    Extract static features from the malware's binary file, such as import/export function names, sections, headers, and other characteristics.

    Code Analysis:
    If possible, analyze the actual code and instructions used by the malware to identify patterns and obfuscation techniques.

    Execution Environment Information:
    Gather information about the host environment, such as operating system version, hardware details, user privileges, and software installed. This can help in understanding how the malware behaves differently on various systems.

    Behavioral Anomalies:
    Identify behaviors that deviate from normal software behaviors, which can be useful for distinguishing between benign and malicious software.
